# TraceLLM

An implementation of the watermarking technique for LLMs described in the paper "[A Watermark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10226)" by Kirchenbauer, Geiping, Wen, Katz, Miers, and Raskar.  It allows you to nearly invisbly embed a watermark into text generated by your LLM, enabling detection of whether a given text snippet was likely produced by your specific model.  ​​This is accomplished through probabilistic tuning of the output tokens via hashing of predecessors, causing minimal effects to the quality of the output while also being able to pick up the water from just a few sentences.
